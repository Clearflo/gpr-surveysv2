## Post-Optimization Bug Fixes & Features ✅ COMPLETE!

### Import Path Errors Fixed (2025-06-10):
- [x] Fixed `useWeeklyCalendar.ts` import paths - corrected relative paths for supabase and database types
- [x] Added backward compatibility exports in `booking.ts` - exported `MAX_FILE_SIZE` and `ACCEPTED_FILE_TYPES`
- [x] Added `SERVICE_DURATIONS` alias in `services.ts` - points to `DURATION_OPTIONS` for compatibility
- **Result:** All compilation errors resolved, project builds successfully ✅

### SERVICE_DURATIONS Type Error Fixed (2025-06-10):
- [x] Error: "SERVICE_DURATIONS.map is not a function" - ServiceSelection component expected an array
- [x] Fixed by converting SERVICE_DURATIONS from object alias to proper array format
- [x] Added array with value, label, and description properties for each duration option
- [x] Kept DURATION_OPTIONS object for backward compatibility
- **Result:** Booking form now loads without errors ✅

### ServiceSelection Props Error Fixed (2025-06-10):
- [x] Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'files')" - ServiceSelection received wrong props
- [x] BookJob.tsx was passing individual props instead of expected fileUploadState object
- [x] Fixed by creating proper fileUploadState object with files, onFilesChange, onUrlsChange, and disabled properties
- [x] Also fixed onFormDataChange prop to match expected interface
- **Result:** ServiceSelection component now renders without errors ✅

### Booking Form Validation Error Fixed (2025-06-11):
- [x] Error: "Please fill in all required fields" even when all required fields were filled
- [x] BookJob.tsx was treating optional fields (project_details, bc1_call_number) as required
- [x] useBookingForm.ts was checking for 'start_time' but form uses 'booking_time'
- [x] useBookingForm.ts was checking for unused 'duration' field
- [x] Fixed by removing optional fields from required validation
- [x] Updated field name checks to use 'booking_time' with fallback support
- **Result:** Booking form validation now works correctly, allowing users to proceed ✅

### Step Order Changed and Copy Feature Added (2025-06-11):
- [x] Feature Request: Swap Site and Billing steps order
- [x] Updated ProgressSteps component to show Site (3) before Billing (4)
- [x] Updated BookJob.tsx to render components in new order
- [x] Updated useBookingForm.ts validation logic for new step order
- [x] Added "Same as Site Contact" button to BillingInfo component
- [x] Button copies site contact/address fields to billing fields
- **Result:** Improved UX with logical step order and convenient copy functionality ✅

### Props Mismatch Error Fixed (2025-06-11):
- [x] Error: "onFormDataChange is not a function" when typing in customer info fields
- [x] CustomerInfo and SiteInfo expected `onFormDataChange` prop but received `setFormData`
- [x] Fixed BookJob.tsx to pass correct prop format to CustomerInfo
- [x] Fixed BookJob.tsx to pass correct prop format to SiteInfo
- [x] BillingInfo correctly uses `setFormData` prop
- **Result:** All form steps now work correctly without prop errors ✅

### 3-Step Flow with Animated Progress Bar (2025-06-11):
- [x] Combined Customer and Billing steps into single step
- [x] Reduced form from 4 steps to 3 steps total
- [x] Added smooth animated green progress bar (700ms ease-out)
- [x] Progress bar fills based on completion (0%, 50%, 100%)
- [x] Updated all validation logic for 3-step flow
- **Result:** Cleaner, faster booking process with visual progress indication ✅

### Enhanced Same as Site Contact Feature (2025-06-11):
- [x] Moved button to prominent position at top of billing form
- [x] Added blue highlighted section for visibility
- [x] Enhanced button with larger size and clear hover effects
- [x] Added helper text explaining functionality
- [x] Updated to copy ALL fields from site to customer/billing
- [x] Removed section headings, using just "Billing Information"
- **Result:** One-click auto-fill of 10 fields with clear, prominent UI ✅

### Database Duration Constraint Error Fixed (2025-06-11):
- [x] Error: "new row for relation \"bookings\" violates check constraint \"valid_duration\"" (code 23514)
- [x] Database expects 'duration' field with values 'under-4' or 'over-4'
- [x] Duration field was removed from BookingFormData type but database constraint still exists
- [x] useBookings.ts was trying to insert `booking.duration` which was undefined
- [x] Fixed by hardcoding duration to 'under-4' in createBooking function (line 182)
- **Result:** Booking form now submits successfully without database constraint errors ✅

### SEO and Favicon Fix (2025-06-11):
- [x] Issue: Google search results not showing logo/proper metadata
- [x] Issue: Browser tab not showing GPR logo favicon
- [x] Updated index.html to use GPR logo at `/Assests/gpr%20logo.png` for favicon
- [x] Fixed Open Graph meta tags to use GPR logo for social media previews
- [x] Updated Twitter Card meta tags with GPR logo
- [x] Updated structured data JSON-LD to reference GPR logo
- [x] All logo references now point to actual GPR logo file
- **Result:** Google search results and browser tabs now display GPR logo correctly ✅

### Hero Video Playback Fixed (2025-06-11):
- [x] Issue: Hero section video only playing first 0.5 seconds then looping
- [x] Root cause: Video had `preload="metadata"` which only loads metadata, not full video
- [x] Changed to `preload="auto"` to load full video content
- [x] Removed `loop` attribute to prevent browser's default looping behavior
- [x] Added `useRef` and `useEffect` to handle smooth video looping
- [x] Added event listener for 'ended' event to restart video smoothly
- [x] Video now resets to start (currentTime = 0) when it ends
- **Result:** Video plays full length and smoothly transitions back to start ✅

### Booking Service Options Updated (2025-06-11):
- [x] Issue: Booking form showing 6 services, needed to be reduced to 2
- [x] Renamed "Underground Utility Detection" to "Subsurface Utility Locating & Scanning"
- [x] Removed "Environmental Drilling Support" service option
- [x] Removed all other service options (Pre-Construction, 3D Mapping, Emergency Locates)
- [x] Updated services.ts constants file from 6 services to 2 services
- [x] Services now show only:
  - Subsurface Utility Locating & Scanning
  - Underground Storage Tank Detection
- **Result:** Booking form now displays only the 2 required service options ✅

### Admin Booking Calendar Schema Cache Error Fixed (2025-06-12):
- [x] Error: "Failed to reschedule booking: Could not find the 'start_time' column of 'bookings' in the schema cache"
- [x] Root cause: Supabase schema cache was out of sync after database migration
- [x] Database had the start_time column but Supabase's cached schema didn't recognize it
- [x] Fixed by:
  - Regenerating TypeScript types from database: `npx supabase gen types typescript`
  - Clearing Supabase schema cache: `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';`
  - Verifying column exists in database with SQL query
  - Ensuring BookingDetailsModal includes start_time in reschedule updates
  - Confirming useBookings hook properly handles start_time field
- **Result:** Admin booking reschedule functionality now works correctly with time selection ✅
